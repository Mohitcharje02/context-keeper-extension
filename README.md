üìë Context Keeper - Chrome Extension
Context Keeper is a powerful Chrome extension designed to save and restore your entire browsing context with a single click. It goes beyond simple tab management by saving the scroll position, form data, and even video timestamps, so you can pick up exactly where you left off after an interruption.

üöÄ What it Does
Ever been deep into research with 20 tabs open, only to accidentally close the window? Or maybe you were filling out a long form and had to restart your computer? Context Keeper solves these problems by allowing you to save a snapshot of your current browsing session‚Äînot just the URLs, but the state of each page.

‚ú® Key Features
Full Context Saving: Saves open tabs along with their scroll position, form inputs, and video playback time.

One-Click Restore: Re-opens all saved tabs and restores their saved state automatically.

Selective Restore: Choose to restore all tabs from a saved session or select specific tabs to open.

Modern UI: A clean, beautiful, and intuitive "glass morphism" interface.

Session Naming: Give your saved contexts custom names (e.g., "Work Research," "Holiday Planning") for easy organization.

Lightweight & Fast: Built with pure JavaScript, ensuring minimal impact on your browser's performance.
